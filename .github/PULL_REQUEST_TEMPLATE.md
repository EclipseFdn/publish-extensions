## A note about PRs adding or fixing extensions

### For extension authors

Although this repository is all about extensions, it is very hard to manage houndreds of extensions just by our team, we don't have the capacity to take care of every new broken extension, which includes new extensions. If you are the author of this contributed extension, please take the time to integrate OpenVSX publishing into your extension. You can refer to our [direct publish setup](docs/direct_publish_setup.md) doc for a guide on how to do it easily.

### For community contributors

For the sake of efficiency and simplicity, the easiest way to publish an extension is by having it published by its maintainers, for more info about this please refer to the [README](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions#when-to-add-an-extension). If the authors are open to publish the extension to OpenVSX, you can help them by contributing a GitHub Action using our handy-dandy [direct publish setup](docs/direct_publish_setup.md) doc. 

 - If the extension is unmaintained, please create an issue for it instead.
