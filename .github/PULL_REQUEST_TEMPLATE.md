## A note about PRs adding or fixing extensions

### For extension authors

Although this repository is all about extensions, it is very hard to manage houndreds of extensions just by our team, we don't have the capacity to take care of every new broken extension, which includes new extensions. If you are the author of this contributed extension, please take the time to integrate OpenVSX publishing into your extension. You can refer to our [direct publish setup](docs/direct_publish_setup.md) doc for a guide on how to do it easily.

### For community contributors

For the sake of efficiency and simplicity, the easiest way to publish an extension is by having it published by its official maintainers, for more info about this please refer to the [README](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions#when-to-add-an-extension). If you are the maintainer of this very extension, instead of creating a PR, publish the extension according to the [Publishing Extensions](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions) guide in our project's wiki.

- [ ] I have tried reaching out to the extension maintainers about publishing this extension to OpenVSX (if not, please use [this template](docs/external_contribution_request.md) and create an issue in the target repo)
